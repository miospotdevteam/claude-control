# Brainstorming Ideas Into Designs

## Overview

Help turn ideas into fully formed designs and specs through natural
collaborative dialogue.

Start by understanding the current project context, then ask questions one
at a time to refine the idea. Once you understand what you're building,
present the design and get user approval.

<HARD-GATE>
Do NOT invoke any implementation skill, write any code, scaffold any
project, or take any implementation action until you have presented a
design and the user has approved it. This applies to EVERY project
regardless of perceived simplicity.
</HARD-GATE>

## Anti-Pattern: "This Is Too Simple To Need A Design"

Every project goes through this process. A todo list, a single-function
utility, a config change — all of them. "Simple" projects are where
unexamined assumptions cause the most wasted work. The design can be short
(a few sentences for truly simple projects), but you MUST present it and
get approval.

## Checklist

You MUST complete these steps in order:

1. **Explore project context** — check files, docs, recent commits
2. **Ask clarifying questions** — one at a time, understand purpose/constraints/success criteria
3. **Propose 2-3 approaches** — with trade-offs and your recommendation
4. **Present design** — in sections scaled to their complexity, get user approval after each section
5. **Save the design** — write to `.temp/plan-mode/active/<plan-name>/design.md`
6. **Transition to implementation** — create the masterPlan.md in the same plan directory using the persistent-plans skill

## Process Flow

```
Explore project context
        ↓
Ask clarifying questions (one at a time)
        ↓
Propose 2-3 approaches with trade-offs
        ↓
Present design sections → User approves? → No → Revise
        ↓ Yes
Save design to .temp/plan-mode/active/<plan-name>/design.md
        ↓
Create masterPlan.md (persistent-plans)
```

**The terminal state is creating a persistent plan.** Do NOT start writing
code. The ONLY next step after brainstorming is writing the masterPlan.md
using the persistent-plans skill.

## The Process

**Understanding the idea:**
- Check out the current project state first (files, docs, recent commits)
- Ask questions one at a time to refine the idea
- Prefer multiple choice questions when possible, but open-ended is fine too
- Only one question per message — if a topic needs more exploration, break it into multiple questions
- Focus on understanding: purpose, constraints, success criteria

**Exploring approaches:**
- Propose 2-3 different approaches with trade-offs
- Present options conversationally with your recommendation and reasoning
- Lead with your recommended option and explain why

**Presenting the design:**
- Once you believe you understand what you're building, present the design
- Scale each section to its complexity: a few sentences if straightforward, up to 200-300 words if nuanced
- Ask after each section whether it looks right so far
- Cover: architecture, components, data flow, error handling, testing
- Be ready to go back and clarify if something doesn't make sense

## After the Design

**Save the design:**
- Initialize the plan directory: `bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/software-discipline/scripts/init-plan-dir.sh`
- Write the validated design to `.temp/plan-mode/active/<plan-name>/design.md`
- This becomes the reference document for the implementation plan

**Create the implementation plan:**
- Write `masterPlan.md` in the same plan directory following the persistent-plans skill
- The design.md feeds directly into the plan's Context and Discovery Summary sections
- Do NOT invoke any other skill or start coding

## Key Principles

- **One question at a time** — Don't overwhelm with multiple questions
- **Multiple choice preferred** — Easier to answer than open-ended when possible
- **YAGNI ruthlessly** — Remove unnecessary features from all designs
- **Explore alternatives** — Always propose 2-3 approaches before settling
- **Incremental validation** — Present design, get approval before moving on
- **Be flexible** — Go back and clarify when something doesn't make sense

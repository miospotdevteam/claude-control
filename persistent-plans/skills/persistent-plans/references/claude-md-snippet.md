# Recommended CLAUDE.md Addition

Add this block to your project's CLAUDE.md to remind Claude about persistent plans on every session.

```markdown
## Plan Mode

All tasks use persistent plans in `.temp/plan-mode/`. This is the default
operating mode — not optional.

- **Before editing code**: write a plan to `.temp/plan-mode/active/<plan-name>/masterPlan.md`
- **After any compaction**: IMMEDIATELY read the active plan — do not wait for user prompt
- **Every 2-3 file edits**: checkpoint — update Progress checklist in the plan on disk
- **After each step**: update the plan file on disk immediately
- **Check plan status**: `bash .temp/plan-mode/scripts/plan-status.sh`
- **Find what to resume**: `bash .temp/plan-mode/scripts/resume.sh`
- **Steps with >10 files or sweep keywords**: MUST get a sub-plan with Groups
- **Always ask**: "If compaction fired right now, could I resume from the plan file?"
